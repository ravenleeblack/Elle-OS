# Elle-OS

I have been programming for quite a few years in pure c and nasm. I have most of a compiler finished, for my own language Illeshian, without any tools so it was no surprise when my interest delved deeper and I found the love of os development. What can I say, I like a challedge, and I inspire to be like the orginal old school programmers who knew their stuff really well. I am not looking to make a windows or linux clone nor do I want to port their tools into this os.

I would like to start Elle out being being a 32-bit multitasking os. Currently its does nothing but show some vesa graphics on the screen. I have been trying to write my own functions for the graphics and just using the video buffer. I dont want to use vesa's actual functions.
