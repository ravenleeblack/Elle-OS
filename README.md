# Elle-OS

I have been programming for quite a few years in pure c and nasm. I have most of a compiler finished, for my own language Illeshian, without any tools so it was no surprise when my interest delved deeper and I found the love of os development. What can I say, I like a challenge, and I inspire to be like the original old school programmers who knew their stuff really well. 

I would like to start Elle out being being a 32-bit multitasking os. I am not looking to make a windows or linux clone nor do I want to port their tools into this os. I am having fun designing what I can without tools. Currently its does nothing but show some vesa graphics on the screen. I wasnt realy trying to be the graphics first guy but it turned out to be easier then alot of other things. So I wrote some functions, to at least, start testing stuff and using the framebuffer without vesa's functions.
